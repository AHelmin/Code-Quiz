One the quiz has started, select the answers from a choice of four by pressing the correct button. Each right answer awards 5 points, while each wrong answer subtracts 10 seconds from the time. The final score is calculated by adding the score with the remaining time. This is a test of not only knowledge but also mouse dexterity.

You can navigate to the Highscores page at any time by clicking the View Highscores link on the top of the page.

Each time you are done with the quiz you can enter your initials and your score will be stored. When on the Highscore page, you can either choose 'Go Back' to start again, or 'Reset Highscores' to erase all stored scores.
